Test.java- Static Block Without Using Main method
		Yes, we can execute a java program without a main method by using a static block. 
		Static block in Java is a group of statements that gets executed only once when the class 
		is loaded into the memory by Java ClassLoader, It is also known as a static initialization block. 
		Static initialization block is going directly into the stack memory.

					Example
					class StaticInitializationBlock{
					   static{
					      System.out.println("class without a main method");
					      System.exit(0);
					   }
					}
					
					
					
In the above example, we can execute a java program without a main method (works until Java 1.6 version). 
Java 7 and newer versions don’t allow this because JVM checks the presence of the main method before 
initializing the class.
